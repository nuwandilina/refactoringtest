# Refactoring test in C#

You are asked to refactor the UserService class and more specifically its AddUser method by applying clean code principles. Ensure it is backwards compatible with `LegacyApp.Consumer`. Any changes to `LegacyApp.Consumer` will be considered a failure.

Try to keep this exercise below 2-3 hours. If you still have things you can improve after the 3 hour mark, please write them down and we will take them into account.

If you have unit testing experience, then create a happy path test using whichever testing and mocking framework you are comfortable with.

Keep in mind acronyms such as SOLID, KISS, DRY and YAGNI.
